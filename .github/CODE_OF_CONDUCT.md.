# Code Of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the cyber•Congress community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be immediately ignored by our Great community.

## Our Culture and Values

- Contributing. All contribution are welcome! We don't care about contributor's gender, race, religion, form, abilities, age and skin colour. We waiting for contribution from community regardless who is it: robot, humanoid or cosmic entity. All what we need is coincidence of values. We want to evolve open source community as hard as it possible.
- Security. We don't work with fiat and paper hassle, but with digital signatures only.
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is her right to do so.
- Open source software. Everything we run in production should be open source.
- Open source hardware. Every piece of hardware production should be repeatable using open source.
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building.
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of information.
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions.
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit such as conflict of interest or NDA.
- Capital, not salary. Helping to switch from slavery salary to capital based passive income.
- Engineering is marketing. We better spend our resources on engineering.
- Physical liberty. All limitations for physical liberty can be economic, not authoritative.
- Automation. Everything that can be automated must be automated.
- Intelligence. An entity can be treated as intelligent if she can control her private keys and sign transactions.
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized shall be decentralized.
- Always on edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails.

## Our Goals

- Integrate into cybereconomy humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking creations.
- Demolish state borders across the earth.
- Find an open approach for creation of incentivized /decentralized general AI.
- Switch governments' business model from violent taxes to non-violent UBI.
- Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation.
- Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to a completely electronic and digital environment.
- Significantly extend living capabilities for species up to but not limited to 10k years.
- Create the foundation for thermoregulation and terraforming of the Earth and nearby planets.
- Build the foundation for the emergence of unified spacetime ownership registry.
- Participating in development of Metaverse.

## Our Stack
We are going to advance and deploy the following technologies available at the moment:
- SAI: digital signatures, neural cryptography, game theory, deep learning, digital DNA.
- GAI: consensus computers, zero-knowledge proofs, game theory.
- Prediction markets: decentralized oracles / prediction schemes, such as Augur or Gnosis.

- Computer brain interfaces and digitalization of mind: OpenBCI, machine learning algorithms.
- VR/AR: OSVR, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Microsoft Hololens, Google Tango, HEP.
- Mesh networks: SDR, Skycoin, single-board computers, lightning networks, game theory.
- Location protocols: FOAM protocol  and beacons technology.
- Sustainable energy: solar, wind, geothermal, thermonuclear fusion.
- Сontemporary computing: quantum, ternary and neuromorphic chips, ASICs, TPUs, memory convergence.
- Biological engineering: DNA sequencing => biological circuits => CRISPR => incubation & learning.
- Space exploration: BFR and alternatives, satellites/cubesats.

## Expected Behaviors

We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully. We call out common situations where this is especially important. For example: when people disagree, when people join a project midstream, when people are unclear in their communication style, and when you feel the need to leave the community. We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issue, pull request, comment, email, or chat text) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is especially important that you convey these attitudes in text. This includes the following behaviors:

**Assume positive intent.**
When someone posts something we expect community members will assume positive intent on the part of the post. We may choose to disagree with the idea and reject the suggestion, but we expect that it was made in order to be supportive of the community goals.

**Respectful to participants.**
We expect participants will disagree on aspects of this project. Disagreements must remain professional. Even if we reject someone’s idea, we continue to welcome their participation. And if your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.

**Seek to understand.**
Open Source projects can be learning experiences. When someone poses something you find disagreeable or you don’t understand it, inquire about it. Ask, explore, challenge, and then assert if you agree or disagree.

**Welcoming to new members.**
New members bring fresh perspectives. Many will raised questions that have been addressed before, You can point them to existing discussions for them to get up to speed. Don’t punish them for being new to the project -- everyone is new to every project once.

**Kind to beginners.**
Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to to reject code with kindness.

**Consider your impact on others.**
Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.

**Use words carefully.**
We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Poe’s Law suggests that without an emoticon is it likely that someone will misinterpret sarcasm. We ask community members to communicate plainly.

**Exit with class.**
There may come a time where you stop believing in the project direction or get frustrated with the project leaders. You are always free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly accommodates this. It does not have to be dramatic or bitter. Sometimes you just walk away, and it’s OK.


## Unacceptable Behaviors

We call out examples of behaviors which cause members to lose their good standing in the community. These include insulting people on the basis of their protected-class status, threatening words, or unwanted sexual attention. Rather than fighting back, please report every incident directly to the project *Response Team*.  Participants in this open source community remain in good standing when they do not conduct themselves in a manner that violates this Code of Conduct. Misconduct includes:

Calling out project members by their identity or background in a deliberately negative or insulting manner. This includes but is not limited to slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes such as race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, membership of a national minority, mental or physical ability.
- Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.
- Threats of violence or intimidation or any project member.
- Unwanted sexual attention or behavior unsuitable for the topic of the open source project.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.

We cannot list all forms of harassment in an exhaustive manner, nor do we seek to declare some forms of harassment as benign or not worthy of action. Rather, if a project member feels harassed we ask they report the incident. The incident will be recorded and addressed. Furthermore we insist that the victim of this harassment not address the issue in the forum in public, as this tends to intensify the problem for the parties in question and for the community as a whole.
