# cyber~Congress: The evolution of species
[@xhipster](https://keybase.io/xhipster), [@litvintech](https://keybase.io/litvintech), [@serejandmyself](https://keybase.io/serejandmyself)

Version 3

> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself. Carl Sagan.

## The Mission
To help the evolution of species!

Over 40 years ago, Earth launched Voyager 1 and 2 into deep space. Until today, this mission [is ongoing](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/) and keeps uniting us as species and gives all of us hope. With the Voyagers, our species sent the [`golden record`](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/) to space, assembled out of 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder, birds, whales, and other animals. To this, they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages. 

That record carries what we believe in, with this, below, we have outlined the goals and values that we believe in the most. This is a hard mission, as our foremost wish is freedom and outlining anything when speaking of freedom is hard. 

## The Idea
We do not believe in captchas. We do not believe in KYC. We do not believe in licensing and any other similar to the above-mentioned bullshit. We do believe in code. We believe in innovation and in making use of our knowledge to make the world a slightly better place for our children. However, blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development which was previously impossible. [cyber~Congress](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress), is a sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen who create on its mission the foundation for a new kind of existence.  

## The manifest
The most difficult thing about a freedom manifest is making it not sound like a manifest. 

The great John Lenon once said:
`Imagine there's no countries`
`Nothing to kill or die for`
`And no religion, too`
`You may say I'm a dreamer`
`I hope someday you'll join us`
`And the world will be as one`

Those words are not kept to their original order, but they still carry the same message that we share.

We have goals and values. Most of our goals we recreate into general issues on our roadmap. from there, you may follow any of these and see how they break down into tasks and overgo an evolution until there is a result. 

Most of our goals and values overlap. Some of them can be expresses as a reference to movies, songs, poetry, academic research. Some are easier listed:

- Security: We do not work with fiat and avoid bureaucratic paper hassle. We prefer to work with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy: If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so. We respect it
- Open-source software: Everything we release into production should be open-source and auditable
- Open-source hardware: Every piece of hardware that goes into production, should be open-sourced and auditable
- Transparency: We believe that transactional transparency is fundamental to building decentralized communities
- Informational freedom: Local laws should not prohibit data flow and information
- Economic freedom: Nobody should prevent or block public transactions
- Free will: We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary: Helping to switch from dragging to the bottom salary to a capital-based, passive income for species 
- Engineering is marketing: We would rather spend our resources on engineering than on marketing
- Physical liberty: Limitations to physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation: Everything that can be automated, should be automated
- Intelligence: An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can provably communicate
- Decentralization: Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge: We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

By sharing those values we want to show what drives us. What makes our inner clocks tick. Those values unite us. If you check out the project `roadmap`, you will find a list of episodes, ranging from I - V. These [episodes](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/2), as already mentioned, include our goals. 

They can be grouped into the following categories:

- Science: building a strong scientific foundation, space exploration, technologies that can transfer human conciseness, extend living capabilities, improve ecology (thermoregulation) 
- Development: improving consensus computers, developing interfaces, integrating post-quantum cryptography, independent robots, open tools for biological engineering, develop metaverse    
- Economy: achieving an incentivized system for all types of actors, self-sustainability, access to equal economics to all species, creating incentives for AI
- Transparency: providing access to transactions, lack of censorship, demolishing borders and states
- Privacy: a possibility for private communication
- Governance: finding replacements for control, open unified registries
- Social: abolishing fear, freedom of choice, bringing sociology and anthropology back to natural ways

Below is one of the most important quotes ever said on Earth by Carl Sagan:

> Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

> Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

> The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

> It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

`We share this vision, but we look forward and even beyond it.`

We understand that technicalities are boring, but we want to be transparent. To achieve our goals we will utilize any type of appropriate to our values technology that either exists or create it ourselves.

May the code be with you. Don't believe. Don't fear. Don't ask!
