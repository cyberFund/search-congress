# IBC: a game-changer for the world wide web

@serejandmyself @xhipster

## Introduction

Since the rise of blockchain technology evolves for the sake of decentralization and humanity, rather than feeding megacorps and solitary beneficiaries. But even today, communication in technology, and especially in blockchain, is still an issue. The extent of problems for interoperable protocols has to take into account is astonishing: security, efficiency, horizontal scalability, etc.

Luckily for blockchain and technology, communities like Cosmos are solving these issues. With the birth of IBC, sovereign blockchains will now be able to communicate and swap data. In cyber~Congress we are convinced that IBC will do for web3, a similar job, to what HTTPS does for web2. In this article, we want to discuss IBC as a better alternative to HTTPS and draw some use cases which we were able to imagine while creating cyber, a web3 alternative to google.

## IBC vs HTTPS

Let us establish a good metaphor. In the current web, almost every site has its own database. When a website needs to exchange information with another site it does so by exchanging some server-side script query (mostly over https://), uses a trusted domain for the required data and produces a write response to the database of the site. Blockchains are also databases. Due to blockchains having superior properties, such as [SPoF resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure), it is not hard to predict that all existing websites will gradually move their operations to these new kinds of databases.

Okay, but why would this transition happen? The real question that needs to be asked, is what it is you can do with IBC, that you cannot do with HTTPS...

[@pmarka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) [once said](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/):

> If you have the money or the asset, you can pay with it; if you don’t, you can’t. This is brand new. This has never existed in digital form before.

A simple answer to the above question is: Everything, that needs a provable and a trustless execution.

## What is cyber?

A protocol for answers. Cyber dreams to make knowledge interoperable. Provable, auditable and verifiable knowledge, that can make a foundation for an open and a decentralized semantical field for the new, Great Web, with a lot more to be yielded as a result.

## Why does cyber need IBC?

Cyber can become an oracle of data for other chains. Cyber is a decentralized google for provable and relevant answers. It builds a decentralised knowledge graph, which thanks to cyberlinks and properly designed economic incentives, can easily act as a predictive model for the universe.

As cyber is planning on indexing and crawling through a vast amount of data, it can easily become an influential computational source of power amongst users. A truly decentralized root of knowledge can help to add relevance to other chains that build knowledge graphs of their own. But, that is by far not it. Due to cybers nature of being able to dynamically rank objects, it can become a market for reputation and ranking, and if necessary being able to transfer them to other chains through the powers of IBC.

## Why does IBC matter for search engines?

Cyber is a general-purpose search engine. Search needs to communicate among distributed databases. Think google. It doesn't search through as many things on the Internet as you might think. In fact, many things like, certain social networks, academic work, etc, stay out of the scope of the big evil beast that google has become. A search engine powered by cyber and IBC can fix this. The idea is to create intercommunication between knowledge graphs, so that cyber can supply knowledge - on relevance, from any chain, in a trustless, but, in a provable manner by returning information about ranking.

An Inter-Knowledge Protocol or IKP, powered by IBC, can function in several ways:
- Subscription to the relevant content identifiers
- Subscription to ranking information for content identifiers
- Determination of value for the data behind content identifiers

## Personal knowledge graphs

The goal behind cyber as a protocol is not just to stay a source of verifiable knowledge. By using cyb, a decentralized, personal browser application for web3, people can create their own, specifically targeted knowledge graphs. Thanks to IBC personal knowledge graphs can communicate with common public knowledge.

## How will IBC be used at cyber hub level?

Firstly an IKP, that functions as a communication artery over IBC. The main exchange of knowledge for the new, Great Web, between any chains connected to the cyber hub via IBC. And, of course, any other hubs connected to cyber via IBC.

Different specific knowledge search engines might have different purposes and different goals. They might (and probably will) have own governance, tokens and needs. IBC in cyber will be able to provide just that - establish cross-communication between those zones.

With the help of IBC, zones within cyber will be able to take advantage of forming a bigger picture and partnering to support one another. This will also help to reduce the burden of indexing knowledge that already exists within the hub itself.

The cyber hub will function as a major artery of the market, becoming a trade hub for domain-specific knowledge graphs. Onchain market makers may provide additional liquidity to projects who choose to fork and use cyberd as a module on their blockchain. Thanks to IBC tokens can be transferred back and forth.

## Location-based search

With the help of IBC, cyber can help other chains that are focused on particular ideas, with proofs and with value. For example, a location-based search (for chains like FOAM) can also become provable, if web3-agents will mine triangulations and attach ‘proof of location’ for every linked chain.

## Interchain governance

Of course, just as chains inside the hub may take advantage of IBC, chains outside will benefit too. IBC will bring the ability to cross governance for blockchains. And, theoretically, cross security in chains. This will create competitive markets for validation. Via the use of IBC cyber will be able to bring its share of this to the market.

## Interchain of markets and thinking beyond existing borders

We already mentioned rank markets and knowledge markets. But what about the real endless possibilities that IBC gives any chain in terms of data transfer?

Data transfer can, and will, create a massive organic, never-ending, marketplace for web3. Where one chain can trade rank with cyber for X and another for Y.

Semantics makes the world spin round. It is used in political decisions, in logistics, in mapping, in financial decisions, social decisions, used to gain knowledge, etc. It can easily become an important trading asset.

If we look at the broader picture, then your digital print (or your soul) has been wondering the digital realm for years and with blockchain and cryptography on the scene, your digital soul has gained digital money, digital freedom in decision making (consensus rules) and a digital fingerprint (your private key). People need to understand that the further we move, the more important it becomes to make sure we are in control of our information.

cyber and cyberlinks provide those super-powers. IKP over IBC helps cyber to spread this asset amongst humanity and well beyond it. Creating cross-communication between knowledge graphs, that aren't just charged by humans, but with the help of machine learning, knowledge graphs that are charged by anything with an electromagnetic impulse.

Such a simple mechanism that cyber provides, changes the game. It changes the existing semantic field and gives the power of decision making back into the hands of the people. Along the way, creating a place for things like autonomous robots, personal data and knowledge bases, prediction markets, oracles and even predictive modelling of emotional mechanisms with the help of second layer semantics.

Cyber is a decentralized google. Wouldn't it be fair if anyone could own a piece of google? IBC gives cyber those abilities. To help spread one of the most important assets that humanity created amongst any kind of thinking species.

## A note to the cyber community participating in GoZ and IKC PoC

We are going to release 2 cyber zones based on the latest and up to date Cosmos-SDK release. This will include IBC support with Cosmwasm integration. We will prepare the required documentation and our team will also participate in GoZ disciplines. Testing not just IBC but also IKC over IBC. 

This will include plans to release cyberlinks transfer between different cyber chains and will become the first case of communication between knowledge graphs. In the case of inter-graph communication, the transferred cyberlinks from one chain to another will belong to the source-chain that made the transfer.  

_Don’t believe. Don’t fear. Don’t ask. Cyber_
