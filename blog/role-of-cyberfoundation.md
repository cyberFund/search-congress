The role of cyberâ€¢Auction is twofold:

\begin{itemize}
\item  It creates non-exlusive long lasting and provable game of initial distribution without necessity to spend energy on proof of work. It is crucial that early knowledge graph were created in some sense fairly by engaged community which was formed during a non-exclusive game.
\item  As a result of auction community will have access to all raised resources under Aragon organization. We believe in a true decentralized nature of the thing we created so we do not want to grab all the money from the funding as we already funded the creation of the system ourselves and we kindly ask fair 100 000 000 000 000  THC cut for pre-genesis investors, founders and developers. Competing with Google is challenging and will be more viable if community will sits on the bag of ever-growing ETH. Given current growth rate of ETH this bag can be very compelling in some years after launch. Also this bag can be the source of alternative implementation of the protocol if Cosmos based system will fail, or in the cased the community just want to diversify technology involved, e.g. ETH2, Polkadot or whatever.
\end{itemize}
