# Preparation to take off

Last months was spend by our team primary on testing all hypothesis in a wild during participation in 2 key events:
- #hackatom in Berlin
- #ipfscamp in Barcelona

It was very exciting to get feedback on our ideas from leading thinkers such as Jae Kwan, Ethan Buchman, Meher Roy, Huan Benet, David Dias, Aaron Davis, and others.

The most important point, that while we had responses which were very different, and sometimes even contradictory, now we are pretty sure that key design decisions are correct and need to be tested in a real-life economic environment.

Another good news is that our test network `euler-4` was run during the last 3 months and now is higher than 3M blocks. While we identified some bugs which are fixed in `euler-5`, now we are confident that technically the network is ready.

Also, thanks to you, we identified that distribution and launching scheme which was presented on [cyberC0n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV-i7ytqL5k) was completely not relevant to what we want to achieve. So we decided to re-engineer the whole launch and distribution scheme which I believe will have a better chance to unite a community and spread the idea. I am happy that there were not so much stakeholder was needed to agree on this fundamental change, thanks to the self-funded model.

## Launch stages

So we decide to launch the network as soon as possible. So yep, Houston, we are ready to take off... How do we see it? While a lot of details are laid out in the [paper](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/cyberd/cyberd/) in general the process will be the following.

1. We will relaunch a test network in the following week or so. The general idea is `euler-5` must be indistinguishable from Genesis, like general repetition. Keep on touch in the #fuckgoogle channel.

2. Pre-genesis round for validators will start at some Cosmos block close to 13.00 GMT on 24 of July 2019. So if you want to participate in this round, please, don't forget to unbond your ATOMs.

3. Genesis will be launched at some Ethereum and Cosmos block close to 13.00 GMT on 4 of September 2019 in the 21st birthday of Google. It is a soft date (aka shelling point) so if something goes wrong we will delay the Genesis launch for as much as we need days.

Please note, that some whitepaper details can be specified unless it will be published in pdf.

## Game of Stakes

Worth to note that distribution scheme has been changed for current validators. We are happy to announce that participation incentives now are (a way) better for the most of participants and are payed from cyberâ€¢Congress allocation:

- 100 GCYB divided between every active validator in the end of `euler-4` spread evenly between participants.
- 1000 GCYB is assigned to `euler-5` Game of Stake with some details coming later.

## The interface

In a parallel, the interface development will be carried out on behalf of Cyb team. We do not expect that we'll be able to ship everything we want before Genesis, but we'll do our best to offer as much as possible.
