It is obvious to all of us, that Twitter as we knew it has come to its end. The inability to bring cryptographic assurance has lead to the behaviour, which we, as a society, should not accept.

Last week at [cyber\~Congress](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cybercongress), we switched our focus, to create the ultimate and [useful example of an app]() on top of the Cyber protocol. We created a better analogue of Twitter. It is a hardcore, crypto-anarchist Twitter. There are no captchas and nobody asks for your phone, name or email address. 

It can already function as an anti-fake and anti-censorship tool, capable of bringing a change to social media. All along with military-grade security.

Nevertheless, why on Earth would you want to use the new Twitter instead of the old one? We decided to start with the principles that are primarily important to ourselves. We believe they will guide you and convince you to join us.

## Content is the King

We removed everything except for the content itself. We believe that this approach can help to be less biased when it comes to discovering our feed. Hence, the feed contains no avatars, names, retweets, or likes. Just the content itself. Because content is the king. Examples of sparks:

## Censorship is the Past

You can tweet about politics, religion, torrents, race and nationality, masters, copyrights, sexual orientation and/or preferences, copyleft, porn... You get the idea. We assume that information should not be obstructed. Censorship killed more people than anything else has during human history.

Instead, we are offering a model of assessment by the community based on evolutionary principles.

## Content is Yours

You publish your tweets and any content to your own node in the IPFS network. The Cyber blockchain works as a tool for linking this content with the targeted semantics. The content is yours and it is only you, who are responsible for your content. This content is not locked and can be used in any application, forever.

## The Feed is Yours

Your feed strictly delivers the shit you're subscribed to. We are tired of feeds which trick us and are constantly trying to sell us BS. We feel that we are smart enough to decide what we want to read and what we don't.

## Ranking as Intuition, not as Cognition

The ranking mechanism of Cyber is economically resistant to Sybil behaviour. Relevance is the thing which has been massively exploited recently. Even though [cyber\~Rank](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#how-is-content-ranked-in-cyber) is a very robust relevance mechanism, we believe it should be used carefully - as a mechanism to enhance intuition, and not as an outsource of cognitive ability.

This tiny colourful frame can help your intuition work better but it does not decide for you.

## Social media ~~or~~ Search

In the existing paradigm, you have a social network as one app, while search capabilities are offered by another. We offer one convenient app for both. As far as we know, this is brand new, no one had done this before and it is sooo fffucking cooooool.

You can read your mentors, while searching for the content you are interested in. Any piece of content has its own unique community of like-minded people, people who care.

## Programmatic Control

One digital signature is an order of magnitude more secure than the conventional approach (think fingerprints). But because one key can be easily compromised, it is not as secure as we wish. Multisig control is the only way to ensure that no crazy shit will ever appear on your feed for those millions of people who trust you.

As far as we know, this is the first tweet in the history of humanity, which has been published using a multi-signature account. This gives us the confidence and the power for change.

And this is just the beginning. The Cyber protocol offers powerful apps on top of [its knowledge](https://cyber.page/brain/knowledge) using the Might of [CosmWasm](https://www.cosmwasm.com/) and the Magic of [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35). Hackers are welcome to deploy programs in Rust right now.

## Conclusion

Enjoy the new feeling with us! The feeling of the Great Web!
