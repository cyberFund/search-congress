# Ultimate cyberd CLI guide. Chain: euler-6

## Install cyberd client

It is possible to interact with cyber even if you don't have your own node. All you need to do is install `cyberdcli` on your machine using the script below (just paste it in the console):

```bash
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybercongress/go-cyber/master/scripts/install_cyberdcli_v0.1.6.sh)
```

To start using the client without an own node, you have to configure some parameter Such as: [key storage](#keyring-manipulation-settings), [connetion to a remote node](#usefull-client-configuration), etc.

After installation you will be able to use `cyberdcli` to [import accounts](#account-management), create [links](#linking-content) or, for example, run a validator.

First of all, I would like to encourage you to use the  `--help` feature if you want to get a better experience of using cyberdcli. This is a really easy way to find all the necessary commands with the appropriate options and flags.

For example, you can enter:

```bash
cyberdcli --help
```

You should see this message:

```bash
Command line interface for interacting with cyberd

Usage:
cyberdcli [command]

Available Commands:
status      Query remote node for status
config      Create or query an application CLI configuration file
query       Querying subcommands
tx          Transactions subcommands

    --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
-e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
-h, --help              help for cyberdcli
    --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
-o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
    --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

The help feature works like a pyramid, you can use it with any command to find available options, subcommands and flags. For example, lets explore the `query` subcommands:

```bash
cyberdcli query --help
```

You can see the structure of the subcommand:

```bash
Usage:
cyberdcli query [command]
```

And the available subcommands and flags:

```bash
Available Commands:
account                  Query account balance

tendermint-validator-set Get the full tendermint validator set at given height
block                    Get verified data for a the block at given height
txs                      Query for paginated transactions that match a set of tags
tx                       Query for a transaction by hash in a committed block

staking                  Querying commands for the staking module

rank                     Querying commands for the rank module

Flags:
-h, --help   help for query

Global Flags:
    --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
-e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
    --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
-o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
    --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

Let's explore the `account` subcommand:

```bash
cyberdcli query account --help
```

We can see all of the options available for this subcommands, namely, account address and flags:

```bash
Usage:
cyberdcli query account [address] [flags]
```

In most cases you will need just two extra flags:

```bash
--from <your_key_name> \
--chain-id euler-6
```

That's it. This is a very useful tool for using cyberdcli and troubleshooting.

## Glossary

**Bandwidth** - The recovered unit of your account. Used to complete transactions in the cyber blockchain. The amount of your bandwidth calculates like:

`your_eul_tokens / all_eul_tokens_in_cyber * 2000*1000*100`.

Messages cost is `100` (exclude link). Transaction consists of one or more messages `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. Transaction cost is `300 + c_1 + c_2 ... + c_n`, where `c_i` - cost of `m_i` message. Full bandwidth regeneration time is 16000 blocks ( ~24 hours ). All bandwith prices, as well as other parameters could be found in our [launch kit](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/tree/0.1.0/params).

**commission** -  The tokens that you've earned via validating from delegators. You may take them at any time

**illiquid tokens** - Non-transferable tokens that you've delegated to the validator. Delegation process duration: 1 block

**Hero** - A validator node

**Unbonding** - The process of taking back your share (delegated tokens + any rewards). 5 days (for `euler-6` only)

**Ledger** - A hardware wallet

**link** - A reference between a CID key and a CID value. Link message cost is `100*n`, where `n` is the number of links in a message. Link finalization time is 1 block. New rank for CIDs of links will be recalculated at a period of 100 to 200 blocks (from 100 to 200 seconds)

**liquid tokens** - Transferable tokens within the cyber blockchain

**local keystore** - A store with keys on your local machine

**rewards** - Tokens that you've earned via delegation. To reduce network load all the rewards are stored in a pool. You can take your part of the bounty at any time with commands from the **delegator** section.

**<comission_rate_percentage>** - The commission that a validator gets for their work. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<delegator_address>** - Delegator address. Starts with `cyber` most often coinciding with **<key_address>**

**<key_address>** - An account address. Starts with `cyber`

**<key_name>** - The name of the account in cybercli

**<operator_address>** - Validator address. Starts with `cybervaloper`

**<shares_percentage>** - The part of illiquid tokens that you want to unbond or redelegate. Must be a fraction >0 and <=1

**<testnet_chain_id>** - The current version of the testnet (current, euler-6).

### Keyring manipulation settings

**Important note**: Starting with v.38, Cosmos-SDK uses os-native keyring to store all of your keys. We've noticed that in certain cases it does not work well by default (for example if you don't have any GUI installed on your machine). If during the execution `cyberdcli keys add` command, you are getting this type of error:

```bash

```

You will have to use another keyring backend to keep your keys. Here are 2 options: store the files within the cli folder or a `pass` manager.

Setting keyring backend to a **local file**:

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file
```

As a result you migth see the following: `configuration saved to /root/.cybercli/config/config.toml`

Execute:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
```

The result should be the following:

```bash
user@node:~# cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
file
```

That means that you've set your keyring-backend to a local file. *Note*, in this case, all the keys in your keyring will be encrypted using the same password. If you would like to set up a unique password for each key, you should set a unique `--home` folder for each key. To do that, just use `--home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/` with setup keyring backend and at all interactions with keys when using cyberdcli:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend file --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys add <your_second_key_name> --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
cyberdcli keys list --home=/<unique_path_to_key_folder>/
```

Set keyring backend to [**pass manager**](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/9cce836c08d14dc6836d07164dd964b2b7226f36/crypto/keyring/doc.go#L30):

Pass utility uses a GPG key to encrypt your keys (but again, it uses the same GPG for all the keys). To install and generate your GPG key you should follow [this guide](https://www.passwordstore.org/) or this very [detailed guide](http://tuxlabs.com/?p=450). When you'll get your `pass` set, configure `cyberdcli` to use it as a keyring backend:

```bash
cyberdcli config keyring-backend pass
```

Verify that all of the settings went as planned:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get keyring-backend
pass
```

### Usefull client configuration

There's some hints you may configure to simplify you interaction with client. To see all possible parameters of those hints just run:

```bash
cyberdcli config --help
```

And here's what you can configure:

```bash
Create or query an application CLI configuration file

Usage:
  cybercli config <key> [value] [flags]

Flags:
      --get    print configuration value or its default if unset
  -h, --help   help for config

Global Flags:
      --chain-id string   Chain ID of tendermint node
  -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
      --home string       directory for config and data (default "/Users/mr_laptanovi4/.cybercli")
  -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
      --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
```

First of all, if you using a standalone client, it is a good idea to set up an address of a node to process all of your transactions. To do this use:

```bash
cyberdcli config node <http://node_address:port>
```

We provide a public API address: `http://titan.cybernode.ai:26657`.

> TO DO add a new address for public API

It will be useful to configure the `chain-id` to avoid entering it every time:

```bash
cyberd config chain-id euler-6
```

If you are having trouble with the [key storage](#keyring-manipulation-settings), you may want to save your home directory for your cli:

```bash
cyberdcli config --home /path_to_cli_home/.cybercli/
```

To check what is the current setup for any parameter run:

```bash
cyberdcli config --get <parameter_name>
```

### Send tokens

```bash
 cyberdcli tx send <from_key_or_address> <to_address> <amount_eul> --chain-id euler-6
```

### Linking content

> Only IPFS hashes are available to use as CIDs

```bash
 cyberdcli link \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --cid-from=<key_phrase_to_link> \
  --cid-to=<content_that_you_want_to_link> \
  --chain-id=euler-6
```

The `cid-from` is the IPFS hash of the keyword that you want to make searchable. Example of a link command:

```bash 
cyberdcli link --cid-from QmWDYzTXarWYy9UKC7Ro4xMCdSVseQPbmdnmTYsJ9zGTpK --cid-to QmVgxX3TVntSNRiQ1Kd8sE8zvEKkbEgb8PaMnA4N7w7pK3 --from fuckgoogle --chain-id euler-6 --yes
```
